- I don't know why the name of folder in Github is C--
- iostream is a header file that contains the declarations of objects and functions used for input
  and output.
- Files to check from 001-basics:
  - 001/05-find-remainder
  - 001/06-modulus-operator
  - 001/11-predict-the-output
  - 002/05-char-data-type
- Output of /, % is wierd for combnination float and int values in C++, avoid going deep
- To take inputs from user, don't use OUTPUT view, use TERMINAL view.
  - Compile the program using g++ filename
  - Run the exe file
- a + b -> a and b are operands, + is operator

**BODMAS Rule**

- According to the BODMAS rule, when multiplication and division are present in the same expression,
  they should be evaluated from left to right, in the order in which they appear. This means that we
  should evaluate the multiplication or division operation that comes first from the left side of
  the expression, and then continue evaluating the remaining multiplication and division operations
  in the order in which they appear.
- Similarly, when addition and subtraction are present in the same expression, they should also be
  evaluated from left to right. This means that we should evaluate the addition or subtraction
  operation that comes first from the left side of the expression, and then continue evaluating the
  remaining addition and subtraction operations in the order in which they appear.
- By following the order of operations correctly, we can ensure that we get the correct result when
  evaluating complex mathematical expressions.
- k = i / j \* j
  - i / j will be evalauted first
  - result \* j will be evaluated
- I was in a wrong intuition all this time .

git rm --cached '\*.exe' - I had ignored .exe files, but those files were not ignored. With this
command, .exe files were ignored.
